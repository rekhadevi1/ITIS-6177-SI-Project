Created an API to connect to  Azure AI Vision-Image Analysis API 
# Azure AI Vision - Image Analysis 
Azure AI Vision Image Analysis is a service provided by Microsoft Azure that allows developers to analyze images using artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. It enables you to extract valuable insights and information from images, such as identifying objects, generating description, detecting faces, determining image characteristics, and more.
# Our ImageAnalysis API
Our API serves as a intermediary API between the user and the Azure API. Instead of having to create an account on Azure and configure it, the user can directly send the requests through our API to the Azure API. This README serves as a detailed guide to use our API.
